## Discussion Topic: Ethicals concerns regarding data ##


## Initial Post ##
As a statistician and researcher, Abi must consider ethical issues when evaluating the nutritional content of the cereal Whizzz. Abi must uphold morality and objectivity in his research.

First of all, altering data values would be highly unethical and go against the rules of scientific inquiry. Falsifying or changing data can have serious legal and professional repercussions, damage to the public's health if harmful products are misrepresented, and undermine the validity of the study (Resnik, 2015).

Second, Abi has a moral duty to give the manufacturer both positive and negative analysis. To make well-informed decisions, findings must be reported transparently and in detail. By supplying all the data, Abi makes sure that the manufacturer is fully aware of any potential benefits or risks Whizzz may have for your health. This enables the manufacturer to make wise choices regarding the public disclosure and promotion of the product (Dhakal, 2016).

Insofar as he is able to predict the outcomes with reasonable certainty, Abi is also accountable for how his program's results are used. He should make the manufacturer aware of any potential risks and restrictions related to the positive analyses, even though he has no control over how the manufacturer will use the results. Mitigating misunderstandings and improper use of the results is made easier by providing thorough documentation and explanations (Dhakal, 2016).).

Abi has a few options if he thinks the manufacturer will only highlight the positive outcomes. He can clearly state in the report that both positive and negative analyses were carried out and that a balanced presentation of findings is required. To ensure broader scrutiny and public awareness, Abi can also share the findings with regulatory agencies or independent research groups. Consulting with legal experts can explore additional options if there are worries about potential harm or violations of legal requirements (Lesser & Nordenhaug, 2004).

I absolutely agree with the main message of Nils Linhoff’s initial post – researchers must be objective and honest in their studies. Changing data values would be unethical and contrary to the laws of many countries (Linhoff, 2023).

Ruckers (2016) highlighted this specific problem in producing in the food industry. According to the paper, when manufactures fund nutritional studies, especially for marketing purposes, there is often an expectation of favourable results. However, such expectations should raise ethical concerns. Another scholar provided some suggestions for ethical vigilance, including designing the research to avoid favouring a particular outcome, establishing clear understandings between the client and the researcher, and publishing results regardless of their favourability (Katan, 2007).

Moreover, if a statistician were to manipulate data to support a specific conclusion, it could be considered scientific misconduct and may result in disciplinary action by their employer or professional organisation. Researchers should adhere to the Code of Ethics for the Nutrition and Dietetics Profession and the other rules.

Hello Nils,

Thank you for this interesting post,
It is important that you highlighted the fact that any manipulation of data would be contrary to the ethical principles of objectivity and accuracy (Tomasetti,2023), which may lead to serious implications concerning the legal and professional field. Therefore, as correctly stated, Abi has the obligation to provide reliable details mentioning both the positive and negative outcomes of the analysis of the product (Linhoff,2023).

However, in our attempt to avoid the case that the manufacturer will provide only the positive results, I support that this situation should be handled in a different manner. I consider that several warnings to the manufacturer as regards the severe legal, social and professional consequences in case of the distortion of the outcomes, would be more effective and would prevent the manufacturer for providing only the positive results . What is your point of view on this reasoning?

## Summary Post ##

I've thoroughly reviewed the insightful posts, and I completely agree with the central message shared by Constantinos Kyriacou and Vasilisa Lukashevich. It's imperative for researchers, like Abi, to maintain objectivity and honesty in their studies to uphold the ethical integrity of their work Manipulating data or presenting only selective positive outcomes would be highly unethical and could have severe legal and professional consequences As mentioned by Ruckers (2016), funding from manufacturers in the food industry might lead to expectations of favorable results, raising ethical concerns. Katan (2007) proposes solutions for ethical vigilance, including designing research to avoid bias, clear communication between clients and researchers, and publishing results regardless of favorability .

I found the suggestion to issue several warnings to the manufacturer about the potential consequences of distorting outcomes to be an effective approach (Lukashevich, 2023). By emphasizing the serious legal, social, and professional implications, we might discourage biased reporting and promote transparent findings. Additionally, sharing the results with regulatory agencies or independent research groups could ensure broader scrutiny and public awareness (Lukashevich, 2023).
