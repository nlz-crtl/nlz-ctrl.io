PG Induction Assignment
 <br>PG Dip Cyber Security <br>
The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the student’s ability to utilize the online resources of the University Essex and to show academic skills such as concise language and correct referencing methods. The course covers the aspects of securing software, networks, databases or systems against cyber-attacks. It also covers Software Development Life Cycle models as well as psychological factors which can contribute to cyber security challenges. Craigen, et al. (2014) defines Cyber Security as following: <br> <br>
“Cybersecurity is the organization and collection of resources, processes, and structures used to protect cyberspace and cyberspace-enabled systems from occurrences that misalign de jure from de facto property rights." <br> <br>
The scope of this course is a postgraduate certification which consists of 60 credits. In contrast to the postgraduate diploma which consist of 120 credits or the full Master of Science which covers the same course as the diploma with an addition of the creation of a master thesis for a total of 180 credits.
In our increasingly digital world, the importance of cyber security cannot be understated. The very real threat of cyber attacks and the associated costs and risks makes it clear that there is a demand for deeper knowledge of cybersecurity. Cashwell et al. (2014) states that security companies estimate the related costs of cyber-attacks in 2003 range from 13USD billion to 226USD billion. In addition, the same report states that the stock price impact of cyber-attacks that identified target firms suffer losses of 1%-5% in the stock market evaluation days after an attack. This showcases the economic impact of cyber-attacks.
Another aspect is data breaches of sensitive data such as user information. From 2005 to 2010 there were over 2280 data breaches and over 512 million related compromised records as tracked by the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (Holtfreter & Harrington, 2015) This shows am alerting increase of data breaches over the five-year period.
Future internet of things developments such as self-driving cars is another area of interest for cyber security. The reliance of self-driving systems on sensors, satellite data and makes it especially vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Yağdereli et al. (2015) declares that autonomous vehicles must be equipped with defensive capabilities and measures such that they can be able to respond automatically and dynamically to both accidental and deliberate defects and attacks.
There is a worldwide skill gap for a competent cybersecurity workforce in the public and private sector. To efficiently protect systems against the previously mentioned threats, this skill gap needs to be closed by providing better cyber security education (Vogel, R. 2016). Hence, that is why the cyber security course at the University of Essex Online is of importance for the society.

I have worked as an IT-consultant and project manager for four years now. From working in infrastructure, managing software projects, setting up cloud computing to designing support processes, cybersecurity is a critical component in all the projects I have managed. In our increasingly digital world cybersecurity is. Almost daily I deal with concerns and questions from customers regarding the security of their digital files and customer information. Especially the concern for private data protection is a vital concern for many companies. I already have some knowledge and hands-on experience with cyber security issues which I think will be helpful for my studies. I especially look forward to the discussions with fellow students and the tutors to broaden my knowledge. I expect the lessons I will learn to be applicable for my line of work and will help to improve the security of my customers systems and to further advance my career.
