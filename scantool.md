## Evaluation: Kali Linux vs. Nessus

Kali Linux is one of the most popular pen-testing tools. It is open-source, flexible and easy to install, 
Kali Linux is a Linux based distribution pre-packaged with tools that can be used for pen-testing or ethical hacking. It offers a great set of tools for web application scanning, vulnerability scanning and database assessments. However, one downside is that Kali Linux is basically limited to scanning and hacking activities, other everyday computer uses are heavily limited. Furthermore, it is not suited for users with limited Linux experience. 
Our group, the Security Squady, has an pen-testing expert with experience in Linux and he will use Kali Linux.

Nessus is available as a free and a paid version. The free version is limited in its functionality. It is easy to install and use. A possible downside is, that Nessus directly communicates with the OS to find vulnerabilities. This is considered as “noisy”.
Nessus is mostly used as a compliance tool to check if the patches are up to date. Hence, for more accurate pen-testing Kali Linux is more useful.
