## Summary Post ##

My initial post was about a GDPR case study about the disclosure of personal data via a social media app. In this case study, an employer of a company published two CVs on the social media app Snapchat without prior consent (Case Studies | Data Protection Commission, no date).
The company eventually dismissed the employee because several policies to protect personal data were breached. The employee was trained and fully aware of the GDPR guidelines nonetheless the data controller is generally responsible for the actions of its employees.


Shota remarked that strict company rules, such as prohibiting mobile phones on company grounds altogether, could prevent such disclosure of personal information. Another idea brought forth by him was the implementation of fines in case of policy dismissal.
Haroun added that the revelation of personal data was due to human error and the employeeâ€™s disregard for company policy. Hence, he suggested rigorous security training and education for all employees as well as stress-testing of procedures (Hadnagy, 2018).

To conclude, human error can never be fully mitigated but it is the responsibility of the data controller to minimize the risk of data disclosure utilizing various methods and approaches.
