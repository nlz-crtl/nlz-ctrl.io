### How will you collect it and what analysis would you hope to perform? How will this answer your research question? ###

In the context of our research methods course, my focus is on a comprehensive examination of cyberbullying. To accomplish this, I have strategically chosen renowned academic databases, namely PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar, as primary sources for data collection and analysis.
IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital Library specialize in technology and computer science, respectively, offering perspectives on the technical aspects of cyberbullying. Google Scholar, with its expansive coverage, acts as a comprehensive aggregator, facilitating an interdisciplinary synthesis of information.
The methodological approach involves systematic searches employing specific keywords such as "cyberbullying" and refinement utilizing filters . The objective is to compile a diverse range of scholarly articles, conference papers, and publications that span psychological, technological, and sociological dimensions related to cyberbullying.
