##Summary Post##         

In the initial discussion post the topic was the popular messaging service WhatsApp which is a subsidiary of Facebook. With currently over 400 million users, which Mathew van Beek confirmed with more recent Data, WhatsApp is a widespread text and voice messaging service which uses networks such cellular networks or Wi-Fi (Brain, 202021). With so much data exchange daily, the confidentiality of the data-in-transit is it is crucial to the customer. That is the reason why the aim of the initial post was to highlight how WhatsApp integrated end-to-end encryption (EE2) or as Dwoskin, 2014 stated ““brought encryption to the masses”.

The initial discussion post conclusion was that WhatsApp invested into the protection of the confidentiality of the data-in-transit via EE2 encryption, but not enough into the protection against malicious data.

Muhammad Nasim Akbary came to a similar assumption after conducting an experiment which consisted of sending maleware via WhatsApp.

A reply from Shota Kameyama mentioned LINE as a competitor of WhatsApp in Japan. LINE is much more then just a messenger and offers services such as a payment system and a shopping function.  It is using, in contrast to WhatsApp, a EE2 protocol called Letter Sealing. Letter sealing is based on the Diffie-Hellman (DH) method of key exchange in which each user has a private and a public key to authenticate, encrypt and decrypt messages, voice calls and data (LINE, 2015).

In regards of data confidentially, Mathew van Beek added the recent case of WhatsApp messages being used as evidence in Court. However, WhatsApp denied access to their database to protect data confidentially as well as not breaching privacy laws (Press Trust of India, 2021).

In conclusion that WhatsApp is offering a good protection of data confidentiality with their end-to-end encryption while the data is in transit. However, it is important to note, that malware can still be sent or received without any security issues as Muhammad Nasim Akbary stated. Furthermore, users of WhatsApp should take other messaging services into consideration such as LINK mentioned by Shota Kameyama. Different messaging services have different security and privacy policies. It would be in the best interest of the user to compare these policies against their requirements before choosing a messaging service
