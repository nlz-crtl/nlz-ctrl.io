## Reflective activity - Ethics in Computing ##

## Task: ##

Consider yourself as a relevant stakeholder, a Computing professional working for a company of your choice. Examine how one or more of the ethical issues mentioned affect your role in the company and what actions you would need to/can take. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature. Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry.



As a computing professional, it is critical to understand and address the ethical issues that affect the technology industry. The ethical concerns in computing are complex and multifaceted, and it is important to evaluate how these issues impact the role of computing professionals in a company. In this essay, I will discuss two of the most significant ethical issues that affect computing professionals, namely data privacy and responsible use of AI, and how these issues can be addressed in a manner that ensures compliance with legal, social, and professional standards.

Data privacy is a critical issue that affects the entire technology industry, and it is of great concern to computing professionals. As technology advances, companies are collecting vast amounts of personal data from users, such as their browsing history, location data, and personal preferences. While this data can be used to improve the user experience and enhance products and services, it also raises ethical concerns about privacy and security.

One of the primary ways to address the issue of data privacy is to ensure that the data collected is stored securely and is not accessible to unauthorized personnel. Data encryption is a critical security measure that can help protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. Additionally, secure servers and networks should be implemented to ensure that user data is not susceptible to hacking or other security breaches.

Furthermore, it is important to be transparent with users about how their data is being collected, stored, and used. This can be achieved by implementing clear and concise privacy policies that outline how user data is being used and what measures are being taken to ensure its security. Additionally, users should be given the option to control their data, including the ability to delete their data or opt-out of data collection entirely.

Another significant ethical issue that affects computing professionals is the responsible use of AI. AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of business operations, but it also raises ethical concerns related to bias and discrimination. For example, if an AI algorithm is trained on biased data, it may produce biased outcomes that discriminate against certain groups. This is a significant ethical issue that computing professionals must address.

One way to address the issue of biased AI is to ensure that the algorithms being used are unbiased and have been thoroughly tested. This can be achieved by using diverse datasets that accurately represent the population, and by testing the algorithms on various demographic groups. Additionally, it is essential to be transparent with users about how AI is being used and what measures are being taken to ensure that the algorithms are unbiased and do not discriminate against certain groups.

It is also critical to ensure that the use of AI is in compliance with legal, social, and professional standards. There are various laws and regulations in place that govern the use of AI, and computing professionals must be aware of these regulations and ensure that they are being followed. Additionally, it is important to consider the social implications of AI and ensure that its use does not violate the privacy or other rights of individuals or groups.

In conclusion, the ethical issues that affect computing professionals are complex and multifaceted. Data privacy and responsible use of AI are two of the most significant ethical concerns in computing, and it is essential to address these issues in a manner that ensures compliance with legal, social, and professional standards. By implementing industry best practices for data privacy and security, using AI in a responsible and ethical manner, and being transparent with users, computing professionals can mitigate the legal, social, and professional risks associated with these issues. It is imperative that computing professionals take a proactive approach to addressing ethical issues and work towards creating a culture of ethical behavior in the technology industry.
