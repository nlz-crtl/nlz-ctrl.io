## Debate Arguments: Future Internet is based on p2p overlay networking: ##

The main arguments to have decentralized internet based on p2p overlay networking such as tor or freenet as described by Clarke et al. (2002) are:
•	No centralized system prone to failure/manipulation/monitoring
•	Reliability: Unlike a client-server network, which can fail if the central server malfunctions, a P2P network will remain functional even if the central server crashes.
•	Adaptability: P2P network make it easy to adopt new clients
•	Reduced costs: less network infrastructure is needed.
