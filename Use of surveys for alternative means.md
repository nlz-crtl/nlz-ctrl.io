## Use of surveys for alternative means: ##
## Task: ##
In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.
Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.



The 2018 Cambridge Analytica data scandal exposed the unethical use of surveys and its implications. Cambridge Analytica obtained and shared data from millions of Facebook users through surveys, raising concerns about data privacy and consent. This incident demonstrated how personal information can be exploited for political manipulation and monetary gain. Deceptive marketing research is another example of inappropriate survey use, where companies collect personal data under the guise of market research but later use it for targeted advertising or sell it without informed consent. These examples have ethical, social, legal, and professional implications. They raise concerns about informed consent, privacy, and responsible data use. They can influence public opinion and democratic processes. They highlight the importance of data protection regulations and enforcement. They damage the reputation and trust of organizations involved. Addressing these issues requires stronger data protection laws, transparency in data handling, and public awareness of the risks. Improved guidelines and ethical considerations are necessary to mitigate the negative impact of inappropriate survey use and safeguard individuals' rights and privacy.
